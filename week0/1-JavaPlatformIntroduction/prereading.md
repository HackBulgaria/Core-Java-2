##Start Here!##

Welcome :) 

Here are a few things you  should probably get done before the start of the core java course:

**1)** Install JDK 8 ( Java SE Development Kit ) - we will work with it
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

**2)** Make sure java binaries are registered in PATH
and that they are **the same version**

```
java -version

java version "1.8.0_31"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_31-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.31-b07, mixed mode)
```
```
javac -version
javac 1.8.0_31
```

**3)** Install Eclipse Kepler from Eclipse site:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/lunasr1a
For those who want to read what it is: https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2014/june/article1.php 

**4)** Read the Google style-guide for Java source code:
http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html

We will be using very similiar style guide, but with the following modifications:
- 4 spaces for identation instead of 2.
- 120 lines for line-wrapping instead of 80.

**5)** Import eclipse preferences (the .epf file) in Eclipse
`File->Import->General->Preferences`

**6)** Import the code formatter (the .xml file) in Eclipse
`Window->Preferences-> Write 'Format' in the search field up left-> Select the one below 'Java' -> Click on Import`

**7)** Create yourself a GitHub account!
If you have never worked with git or GitHub, see the excellent article from
HackBulgaria's programming 101 course:
